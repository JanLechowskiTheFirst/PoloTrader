MACD
all lengths problems:
    misses always candle, as true crossing is during candle and not at the close price of the previous candle
    loses on peeks and all fast/rapid changes
    small changes too - horizontal trend for example are bad

all lengths advantages:AY
    good trend prediction
    likes smooth changes
    on big rises has a lot profit from buying one candle before signal (up to 30%),
    mainly because of spikes at single candles


2h:
    still has spikes, especially on the buy size
    loses on peeks at buy/sell candles a lot

day:
    less money in a year
    very smooth, perfect for MACD
    has a lot of horizontal trend
